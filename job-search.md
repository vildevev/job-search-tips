# Job Searching Tips:

# Code 
	- New technologies - React/Redux, Python/Django, Node/Express
	- Tons of projects 
	- Show them off (github and linkedin, facebook?)
	- Commit often on Github. Employeers often check that. 

# Network
	- Reach out to randos for coffee - same boot camp, college? people seem connected to that stuff.
	- People you know, they know someone that knows someone.  
	- Networking events - at least good talks and free dinner (this one Google event I went to had three courses + open bar)

# Interview 
	- Not ready? bullshit - my first onsite went absolutely horribly (I forgot how to open the rails console) 
	- Becoming familiar with process, start seeing patterns
	- Easily answer "Tell me about this project", "What is your story" - if that's all automated that's one less thing to worry about. 
	- Less anxiety 
	- Lots of irons in the fire - in case job doesn't work out - being able to say "I have several onsites coming up in the next few weeks, you'll have to move quick" - actually, you can just make that up ;)
	- Leverage offers!!

# Algorithms/Interview Prep
	- Do you hate CTCI? I know I do. Leetcode, hackerrank, interviewcake are great resources that don't drain your soul.. 
	- Js data structures and algorithms course
	- Instructing, become more comfortable talking about it etc. Meet up with friends, present a data structure each, tons of meetups too.
	- Solve the algorithm, look up better solutions to problem. Also different, they might ask follow up questions if you solve too quickly 'What if you can't use any space?', 'What if the array isn't sorted' etc. 

# Open Source 
	- Buzzword employeers love 
	- Working with production code is a lot different than building sites on your own. It's all about just implementing tiny changes, following the style of the codebase.
	- Simpler, because you can almost copy paste ex. rspec tests from another file 
	- Write/speak/code meetup for open source, they help you get started.
