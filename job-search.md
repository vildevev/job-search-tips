# Job Searching Tips:

# Code 
	- New technologies 
		###React/Redux [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview)
		###Python/Django - this is a [great book](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) and this is a [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview)
		###Node/Express [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/)
	- Tons of projects. Great working with someone, preferabily someone that's better than you so you learn a ton, also keep each other accountable, push each other.
	- Show them off (github and linkedin, facebook?)
	- Commit often on Github. Employeers often check that. 

# Network
	- Reach out to randos for coffee - same boot camp, college? people seem connected to that stuff.
	- People you know, they know someone that knows someone.  
	- Networking events - at least good talks and free dinner (this one Google event I went to had three courses + open bar :))

# Interview 
	- Not ready? bullshit - my first onsite went absolutely horribly (I forgot how to open the rails console) 
	- Becoming familiar with process, start seeing patterns
	- Easily answer "Tell me about this project", "What is your story" - if that's all automated that's one less thing to worry about. 
	- Less anxiety 
	- Lots of irons in the fire - in case job doesn't work out - being able to say "I have several onsites coming up in the next few weeks, you'll have to move quick" - actually, you can just make that up ;)
	- Leverage offers!!

# Algorithms/Interview Prep
	- Do you hate CTCI? I know I do. [Leetcode], [Hackerrank], [Interviewcake] are great resources that don't drain your soul.. 
	- Please mind that some companies might insist you solve them in javascript, especially if you're applying for frontednd positions. Doesn't hurt to practising now: [Js data structures and algorithms course]
	- Instructing is a great way to become more comfortable talking about it in front of people. Meet up with friends, present a data structure each, tons of meetups too.
	- Solve the algorithm, look up better solutions to problem. Also different ways that aren't always 'better' or more efficient: they might ask follow up questions if you solve too quickly 'What if you can't use any space?', 'What if the array isn't sorted' etc. 

# Open Source 
	- Buzzword employeers love. 
	- Working with production code is a lot different than building sites on your own. It's all about just implementing tiny changes, following the style of the codebase.
	- Simpler, because you can almost copy paste the code from the other files. When I added some rspec tests to a rails app I basically copy/pasted tests from an existing one. 
	- [Write/speak/code meetup] for open source, they help you get started.
